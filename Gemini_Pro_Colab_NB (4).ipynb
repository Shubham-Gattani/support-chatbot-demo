        " The credit system in the IIT Madras BS in Data Science & Applications program is different from the traditional IITM campus credit system. In the BS in Data Science & Applications program, students are required to complete 120 credits to earn a degree. These credits are distributed across four levels of study: Foundation Level (32 credits), Diploma Level (54 credits), Degree Level (28 credits), and Degree Level (28 credits).\n",

In the BS in Data Science & Applications program, students are required to complete 120 credits, while in the traditional IITM campus credit system, students are required to complete 180 credits. This means that students in the BS in Data Science & Applications program will have to take fewer courses to earn a degree.\n",

In the traditional IITM campus credit system, students are required to complete 22 credits in the first year, 25 credits in the second year, 27 credits in the third year, and 26 credits in the fourth year. This means that students in the BS in Data Science & Applications program will have more flexibility in choosing their courses."
